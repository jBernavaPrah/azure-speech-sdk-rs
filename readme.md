Welcome to the Azure Speech SDK, a pure Rust library for interacting with Azure Speech Services.

## Overview

This library aims to provide an easy-to-install and straightforward interface for working with Azure Speech Services. Inspired by the official [Azure Speech SDK for JavaScript](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js), it is designed to be simple and user-friendly.

The library currently supports the following features:

- [X] Speech-to-Text (Speech Recognition)
  - [X] Real-time Speech Recognition
  - [X] Custom Speech Recognition
- [X] Text-to-Speech (Speech Synthesis)
  - [X] Real-time Speech Synthesis
  - [X] Custom Voice
  - [X] SSML Support
- [ ] Speech Translation 
- [ ] Intent Recognition
- [ ] Speaker Recognition
- [ ] Keyword Recognition

The library is currently in the early stages of development, and I am actively working on adding more features and improving the existing ones.

## Why This Library?

The motivation behind creating this library includes:

1. Providing a Rust implementation of the Azure Speech SDK that eliminates the need for the C++ SDK dependency, offering a simpler alternative to existing implementations.
2. Gaining a deeper understanding of Rust. This project serves as a learning experience for me to explore Rust's capabilities and best practices.

## Installation

Add this library to your project using the following command:

```bash
cargo add azure_speech
```
